\section*{Abstract}
In this paper, we propose all optical AND gate using photonic crystal (PC) quantum-dot semiconductor optical amplifiers (QDSOAs) and numerically analyze the input-output characteristics to prove that the gate can operate at 160Gb/s. Moreover, in order to show the effectiveness of the gate, we compare the gate with conventional one in terms of degree of integration, energy consumption and performance.

\section{Introduction}
% 全般的な話
High-speed and large-capacity data transmission is required to cope with increasing network traffic data. In current optical networks, an optical signal goes to its destination through optical fibers with being affected by noise. Thus, re-amplification, re-timing, and re-shaping operations are essential for reliable optical networks. Although electronic devices realize these operations, they have low processing speed and high energy consumption for optical-to-electrical conversion {\cite{3r_regeneration}}. In order to cope with these problems, all-optical signal processing is required and many researchers worked on all-optical devices which realize this technology.
% QDSOAについての話
QDSOA is one of these devices which can be useful in many applications because of its fast gain recovery time and nonlinear optics effect {\cite{qdsoa_aosp}}. QD confines electrons and electron holes, which enables fast gain recovery and SOA's gain saturation enables nonlinear optics effect, respectively.
% PCについての話
On the other hand, the PC is a dielectric material which consists of two different refractive indexes periodically. The lightwaves in a specific bandwidth cannot propagate through the PC. PC waveguides (PCWs) use this characteristic which can be obtained PC slab with creating a line defect. They can confine the lightwaves perpendicular and parallel to the direction which lightwaves propagate. Moreover, their dispersion relation can slow down lightwaves which can be useful when they are combined with SOA or QDSOA. \par
% AOLGsについての話
AOLGs are the applications of all-optical devices which can operate binary inputs. The length of these gates is larger than one of electrical logic gates because all-optical devices require certain length to be a component of AOLGs. For instance, a length of QDSOA is approximately 2-mm long {\cite{qdsoa_nssm}}, whereas the one of transistors, used for commercially available electronic devices, is about 14nm {\cite{current_cpu}}.
% 研究の意義・これからやることの説明
Few researches discuss about the length of device which is important factor for developing high-density integrated and less energy consumption device. Thus, we propose PC-QDSOA assisted all-optical AND gate. AND gate plays an important role for multiplexer and demultiplexer circuits whose applications are communication system, computer memory and arithmetic logic unit. To our knowledge, there is no research about numerically analyzing PC-QDSOA all-optical AND gate. The results in this paper show that the realization of the all-optical AND gate is feasible with the proposed PC-QDSOA all-optical AND gate at 160Gb/s.

\section{PC-QDSOA model}
% PC-QDSOAの構成について
Fig. {\ref{fig:pcqdsoa}} illustrates the schematic diagram of PC-QDSOA waveguide. The PC-QDSOAs used in this study are composed of GaAs, ${\rm{In_{0.15}Ga_{0.85}As}}$, and InAs as an active region to enhance optical power around ${\rm{1.3\mu m}}$-wavelength. The population inversion in the active regions of amplifiers is achieved by passing current through laterally doped ${\rm{p^{+}-p-n^{+}}}$ structures. Also, the waveguide of the PC-QDSOA is W1 PCW wherein slow light can be achieved with either zero group velocity dispersion and zero third order dispersion in specific bandwidth. This waveguide can be archived by creating one line defect in PC slab which has periodical round holes in n- and p- clad region along the direction lightwaves propagate.

% PC-QDSOAがレート方程式で理論解析できることを説明
The operation of the PC-QDSOAs can be theoretically studied by means of a rate equation model {\cite{pcqdsoa}}. InAs QDs consists of a ground state (GS), an excited state (ES), and an upper state (US). A quantum well (QW) is common carrier reservoir for QDs. Due to variability in the size and shape of QDs with use of Stranski-Krastanov mode, the carrier dynamics in the QDs can be described by 1088 variables. Thus, a rate equation of the PC-QDSOA is as follows:

\endgroup
The term $f^{c(v)}_{w}$ represents the carrier occupancy of the QW. Likewise, $f^{c(v)}_{u,j},f^{c(v)}_{e,j},f^{c(v)}_{g,j}$ represents the carrier occupancy of the $j$th group of US, ES, and GS respectively. The term $\Gamma_{k}$ is the optical confinement factor at wavelength $\lambda_{k}$. The term $P_{k,in}$ and $P_{p}$ represents the power of the $k$th photon mode and probe signal, respectively. The term $\alpha(\lambda)$ represents the loss coefficient at a wavelength $\lambda$ which can be the sum of scattering and absorption losses. The term $g_{mod}(t,\lambda_{k})$ is the linear modal gain affected by slow light and can be expressed as the product of slowdown factor, optical confinement factor, and linear material gain of the active region. The term $g^{g(e)}_{j,k}$ is the linear optical gain that the GS (ES) of the $j$-th QD group gives to the $k$-th photon mode is given.

\section{AND gate modeling}
Fig. {\ref{fig:and_gate}} shows the schematic diagram of the PC-QDSOA all-optical AND gate. The AND operation principle is as follows: a modulated data signal A (at wavelength $\lambda_{A}$) and a clock signal (at wavelength $\lambda_{CL}$) are injected into the PC-QDSOA1. Then the signal A will induce less gain amplification on a clock signal via cross-gain modulation (XGM) in the PC-QDSOA1 and the logic output is always NOT A. In the same way as this operation, a modulated data signal NOT A (at wavelength $\lambda_{CL}$) and a modulated data signal B (at wavelength $\lambda_{B}$, which can be the same as the wavelength of data A) are injected into the PC-QDSOA2, and the logic output is then A AND B.

\section{Results}
% 数値解析方法
We numerically analyze the operation of the proposed gate with using MATLAB 2016b and Optisystem 14.0.0. The physical parameters used for solving rate equation can be found in {\cite{pcqdsoa}}. Table. {\ref{table:pcqdsoa_param}} represents the fixed parameters used for the PC-QDSOA AND gate. The pulses are Gaussian shaped. \par

% ER,Qについての説明
To evaluate the proposed gate, we use eye diagram, extinction ratio (ER), and Q-factor as appropriate metrics. An ER can be represented as $ER[dB] = 10\log_{10} \left(P^{1}_{min} / P^{0}_{max} \right)$. $P^{1}_{min}$ represents minimum power of the binary signal ``1'' and $P^{0}_{max}$ represents maximum power of the binary signal ``0''. The Q-factor can be represented as $Q = (S_{1}-S_{0})/(\sigma_{1}+\sigma_{0})$ where $S_{1},S_{0}$ are the average powers of the binary signal ``1'' and ``0'' and $\sigma_{1},\sigma_{0}$ are the standard deviations of those signals. The large numbers of these metrics represent the proposed gate is more appropriate for an all-optical AND gate. \par
% 入出力結果
Fig. {\ref{fig:in-out}} and Fig. {\ref{fig:eye_dia}} show the input-output characteristics and an eye diagram for the output signals, respectively, when current injection is 6mA. These results show that the proposed gate can operate as an AND gate at 160 Gb/s. As shown in Fig. {\ref{fig:eye_dia}}, the ER and Q-factor of the output signals are 8.85 dB and 7.41.
% 注入電流を変えたときの結果
Since the gain recovery time varies due to current injection, we also investigated the effect of current injection on the quality of output signal. Fig. {\ref{fig:ERs_of_pcqdsoa_different_pump_current}} shows the ERs under different current injection. This result shows the ER is improving with increasing current injection. The proposed gate reaches a maximum ER of approximately 9-dB at 160Gb/s. Fig. {\ref{fig:Qs_of_pcqdsoa_different_pump_current}} shows the Q-factors under different current injection. This result shows the Q-factor improve in proportion to current injection. These results can be obtained because pattern-effect is decreasing with increasing current injection.

% QDSOAとの比較結果
In order to show the effectiveness of the proposed gate, we compare the proposed gate with QDSOA AND gate, whose schematic diagram is same as the proposed one. The physical parameters and numerical analysis method of QDSOA can be found in reference {\cite{qdsoa_nssm}}. Table. {\ref{table:qdsoa_param}} represents the fixed parameters used for the QDSOA AND gate. 
Fig. {\ref{fig:comp_ERs}} and Fig. {\ref{fig:comp_Qs}} show the comparison of current injection required to obtain each ERs and Qs for the QDSOA AND gate and the proposed one, respectively. Fig. {\ref{fig:comp_ERs}} shows that to obtain ER approximately 7.5dB, the QDSOA AND gate requires 3000mA, whereas the proposed AND gate requires only 5mA. Likewise, Fig.{\ref{fig:comp_Qs}} shows that to obtain Q-factor about 5, the QDSOA AND gate requires 2800mA, whereas the proposed gate requires only 4mA. Moreover, the device length of the QDSOA is 2mm, whereas the one of the PC-QDSOA is 125${\rm{\mu m}}$. These results show the proposed AND gate can reduce energy consumption and device volume.

\section{Conclusion}
We have proposed PC-QDSOA all-optical AND gate operating at 160Gb/s and evaluated the performance of the proposed gate by using eye diagram, ER, and Q-factor. The results show the proposed gate can operate as AND gate at 160Gb/s when current injection exceeds 6 mA. Better performance can be achieved with increasing current injection and a maximum ER of 9-dB can be obtained. Moreover, we compared the QDSOA AND gate with the proposed gate using numerical analysis to prove the efficiency of the proposed gate. As a result, the proposed gate can reduce energy consumption and device volume.
